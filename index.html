        hey, i'm a CS undergrad, doing machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        i like buiding <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = "https://github.com/peeyuzz">stuff</a> related to ai/ml and programming in general. other interest of mine include travelling, reading, walking and
        always on the hunt for new ideas on x (formerly twitter) [dot] com.

        i believe "because i feel like it." should be the necessary and sufficient condition to build. esp with the ai boom we have a golden oppurtunity to get ahead of the curve and the make the universe dance to our brilliance.

        "born too early to explore the stars.<br>
        born too late to explore the earth.<br>
        born just in time to experience the ai boom loop."
